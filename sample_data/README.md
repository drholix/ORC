# Sample Data

This folder hosts lightweight assets for testing the OCR pipeline locally.

* Run `python scripts/generate_sample_image.py` to create `sample_text.png`, a synthetic PNG containing high-contrast Latin characters for smoke testing.

For more realistic experiments, place your own scans, receipts, or forms in this folder. Keep image sizes reasonable (<=1024px on the long side) for fast iteration on laptops.
